Hello all,

For Wednesday, please have Unreal installed and ready to go. Make sure you bring your laptop’s power supply, this engine is not gentle with power consumption. A mouse would also be a really good idea.

You can download the launcher at https://www.unrealengine.com. You’ll need to make an account if you don’t already have one.

Once the launcher is installed, you can download/install the engine from there. We’ll be using Unreal 4.20.3, as it matches the lab machines.

I’m attaching the Unreal .gitignore as a .txt file. Once you set up your project, you’ll need to add this file to the project root and rename it to .gitignore
